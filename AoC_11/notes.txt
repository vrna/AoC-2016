- if a chip is ever left in the same area as another RTG, and it's not connected to its own RTG, the chip will be fried
- Its capacity rating means it can carry at most yourself and two RTGs or microchips in any combination.
- the elevator will only function if it contains at least one RTG or microchip

- identify state
- identify all possible actions
- simulate all possible states
- if state results in fried state, close the path
- if state results in state "all objects in fourth floor", count the steps and rock on!
- loop on
