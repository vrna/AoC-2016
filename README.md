## thoughts so far

### c-sharp
Started AoC using c-sharp via Sharp-develop.

It might have been a mistake to use c-sharp for one of the first and thus easiest tasks. Though, it was good to learn the basic rules of AoC with a language I was familiar with.

It soon became clear that I was a bit too familiar. I do c-sharp in work, and even though I'm not certainly a top-class expert in it, I still got the "been there done that" -feeling.

The biggest learnings were more to do with the nature of AoC: if your program structure is poor, you will probably face difficulties. Doing good code will always help you to adjust to changes.

### java
For the second day, I switched to Java using NetBeans.

I have done some Java previously, and still, I don't know whether it's the tools I use or the language itself, but I'm not a friend of. To me, Java is maybe too much like c-sharp, but with some annoying little differences here and there.

After doing day 14 with Java, I like it even less.

### javascript
I continued using NetBeans, this time for JavaScript.

Well, I can't say I liked JavaScript. It could be useful when you learn to use the async-methods, especially if you are doing web-programming. It took some time to get started, but in the end it's quite simple language.

### python
Time to move to Python. I installed Python via Anaconda, which helped quickly starting the work instead of spending time loading libraries. I wrote the code simply with Notepad++.

I liked Python. It probably isn't the fastest in some cases, but it's quite straightforward and despite being relatively new to me, it didn't bring any of those "oh god why" -moments that programming languages can sometimes bring.

Python required a lot of googling. Notepad++ doesn't offer by default much intellisense, but with Python that never hurt that much.

Learning the libraries and taking full advantages of advanced scripting would be essential in this language.

One thing though: I wrote day 14 first in Java, then recreated it with Python using practically the same structure, and ended up noticing that it run 2.5 times slower. Yet it was a lot quicker to work it otherwise.

### dart
A co-worker told me about Dart and how that will be next hipster-programming language. Had to try. I installed JetBrains, leaving with 30 days to learn Dart with that tool, before I probably need to switch to Atom instead.

A lot like Java and c-sharp. JetBrains was a good tool. Relatively easy language. There certainly is lot less instructions in Net available. And if you chose your search words poorly, you ended up into pages telling about tossing darts. Dart seems relatively new, meaning you need to rely more on official documentation rather than StackOverflow topics.

### ruby
Time to move to Ruby, using Atom as development environment and command line.

A new language to me. The day 12 was relatively simple, so this was a good moment to try.

Not a good first experience. Had some challenges with my variables, as Ruby allows you to mix variable types in a creative ways, but provided several occasions where simple comparisons didn't work because it was too easy to mix a string and an integer in an array.

### R
I thought this was a mathmatical problem, and somehow I came up with R.

After few hours of investigations, I had figured out that day 15 was about systems of equations and especially Systems of Linear Congruences.

Yet the modulo part didn't come up anyway nicely, and the final solution was more like brute force that could be done with any language.

So didn't quite get into the heart of it yet :(.

### cpp
After initial confusion with the setup (I thought NetBeans would have already installed me the required compilers and all), I got to play with c++. More thoughts maybe later.
